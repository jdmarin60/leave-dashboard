# Leave Request Dashboard

A simple leave request dashboard built with **Next.js** and **SAP UI5 Web Components for React**. It includes functionality to filter leave requests by status, sort them by date, and update their approval state.

## ðŸš€ What Was Implemented

- Display of leave requests with basic information
- **Status filtering** via dropdown
- **Sort toggle** for ascending/descending date order
- **Approve/Reject** functionality for requests
- **Unit tests** for filtering, sorting, and interaction logic

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run the Project

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Press Go to Leave Requests

ðŸ§ª How to Run the Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

Tests are written with Vitest and use @testing-library/react for UI interaction.

ðŸ§± UI5 Components Used
This project uses the following components from @ui5/webcomponents-react:

<Button /> â€“ for triggering actions (sort, approve, reject)

<Select /> and <Option /> â€“ for status filtering

<Card />, <CardHeader /> â€“ for organizing leave request info

Other basic layout components (e.g. <FlexBox />, <Title /> if used)
