A simple leave request dashboard built with **Next.js** and **SAP UI5 Web Components for React**. It includes functionality to filter leave requests by status, sort them by date, and update their approval state.

## ðŸš€ What Was Implemented

- Display of leave requests with basic required information
- **Status filtering** via dropdown
- **Sort toggle** for ascending/descending date order
- **Approve/Reject** functionality for requests
- **Unit tests** for filtering, sorting, and interaction logic

npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at http://localhost:3000.
